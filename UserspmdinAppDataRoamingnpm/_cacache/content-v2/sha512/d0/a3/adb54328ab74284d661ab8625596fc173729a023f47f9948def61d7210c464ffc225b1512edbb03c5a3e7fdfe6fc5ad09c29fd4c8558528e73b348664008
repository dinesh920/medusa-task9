To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>\n  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>\n  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>\n  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href=\"https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib\">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/stdlib\">financially supporting stdlib</a>.

The lower order word contains the less significant bits, while the higher order word contains the more significant bits and includes the exponent and sign.\n\n```javascript\nvar w = toWords( 3.14e201 );\n// returns [ 1774486211, 2479577218 ]\n\nvar high = w[ 0 ];\n// returns 1774486211\n\nvar low = w[ 1 ];\n// returns 2479577218\n```\n\n#### toWords.assign( x, out, stride, offset )\n\nSplits a [double-precision floating-point number][ieee754] into a higher order word (unsigned 32-bit `integer`) and a lower order word (unsigned 32-bit `integer`) and assigns results to a provided output array.\n\n```javascript\nvar Uint32Array = require( '@stdlib/array-uint32' );\n\nvar out = new Uint32Array( 2 );\n\nvar w = toWords.assign( 3.14e201, out, 1, 0 );\n// returns <Uint32Array>[ 1774486211, 2479577218 ]\n\nvar bool = ( w === out );\n// returns true\n```\n\n</section>\n\n<!-- /.usage -->\n\n<section class=\"examples\">\n\n## Examples\n\n<!-- eslint no-undef: \"error\" -->\n\n```javascript\nvar floor = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-floor' );\nvar randu = require( '@stdlib/random-base-randu' );\nvar pow = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-pow' );\nvar toWords = require( '@stdlib/number-float64-base-to-words' );\n\nvar frac;\nvar exp;\nvar w;\nvar x;\nvar i;\n\n// Generate random numbers and split into words...\nfor ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {\n    frac = randu() * 10.0;\n    exp = -floor( randu()*324.0 );\n    x = frac * pow( 10.0, exp );\n    w = toWords( x );\n    console.log( 'x: %d. higher: %d. lower: %d.', x, w[ 0 ], w[ 1 ] );\n}\n```\n\n</section>\n\n<!-- /.examples -->\n\n<!-- C interface documentation. -->\n\n* * *\n\n<section class=\"c\">\n\n## C APIs\n\n<!-- Section to include introductory text.
